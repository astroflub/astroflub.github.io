# 👽 AstroFlub: The Idiot's Guide to the Galaxy 🛸

Welcome to the official repository for **AstroFlub**, a digital corner of the internet dedicated to investigating the universe's most pressing, yet utterly unimportant, mysteries. 

> "If the truth is out there, it's probably stuck to the bottom of a space-boot." — *AstroFlub*

## 🌌 What is this?
This is a static-site blog hosted on GitHub Pages. It’s where I document my high-level, low-IQ hypotheses regarding aliens, socks, and why the speed of light is so fast (seriously, what’s the rush?).

### Current Investigations:
* **[The Great Galactic Sock Mystery](https://astroflub.github.io/blog/alien-socks-mystery.html)**: Are UFOs just balled-up laundry? (Spoiler: Yes).
* **[🔬 RESEARCH - MICROWAVING PIZZA 🍕 IN ORBIT: The Snack that Nearly Sank a Space Station 🚀](https://astroflub.github.io/blog/orbital-pizza-tragedy.html)**: The Truth: The Pizza is an Agent of Chaos

* **More coming soon...** as soon as my dryer reaches warp speed.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (The "Spaceship" Components)
This site is built with pure stardust and:
* **HTML5/CSS3**: For that "retro-future" look.
* **[Giscus](https://giscus.app/)**: Powering our "Thoughts from Fellow Earthlings" section via GitHub Discussions.
* **FontAwesome**: For the shiny icons.
* **Google Fonts**: Specifically the *Bitter* font, because space is a bitter, cold place.
* **GitHub Pages**: Our launchpad.

## 🚀 Deployment & Local Development
Since this is a static site, there's no fancy "build" step. 

1. **Clone the ship:** ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/astroflub/astroflub.github.io.git](https://github.com/astroflub/astroflub.github.io.git)
